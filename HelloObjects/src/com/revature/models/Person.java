    This walk() method is public, so it's visible everything in the application
    It has a return type of String. so, it must return a String (note the return statement)
    It takes no (parameters), so we don't need to supply any arguments when calling this method.

    //constructors below--------------------

    /* Remember, constructors are methods that allow us to give values to our object's variables

     When we instantiate an object, we use a constructor depending on what values we want
     Constructors will have the same name as the Class, but no return type. */

    /* These Constructors are examples of METHOD OVERLOADING
        Overloaded methods have the SAME NAMES, but DIFFERENT PARAMETERS
            By different I mean different number, or order of the data types
            (The return type can be different too)

        This is an example of POLYMORHPISM (a pillar of OOP)
            "Same name/thing different forms" */

    //no-args constructor. It takes NO ARGUMENTS. Typically used to give default values to an object
    //If you create a Person object with no parameters, this constructor will get used
    public Person(){
        this.name = "Daryn"; //String
        this.age = 29; //int
        this.height = 7.5; //double

        //THIS Class's name variable. THIS Class's age variable. etc.

    //no-args constructors are like the default state for an object that we don't customize
    //AKA objects we give me initial values to.

    //all-args constructor. This constructor takes a parameter (argument) for each Person variable

        this.name = name;
