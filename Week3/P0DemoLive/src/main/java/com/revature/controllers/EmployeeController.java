    The controller layer has the sole responsibility of taking in HttpRequests and has the responsibilty of sending the

    For our responses, best practice will be to return an appropriate message in the response body and have the proper
    status code

    Just like before we essentially want to map our CRUD methods to handlers

    TODO Create handlers for the following:
    Create -
    Read (All) -
    Read (One)
    Update
    Delete

    We'll be implementing the create and read all methods and adding stubs for the rest of them
