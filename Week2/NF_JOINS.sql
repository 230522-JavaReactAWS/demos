--This demo will demonstrate Normal Forms 1-3, and Joins (at the end)

/* 1st NORMAL FORM (we do not want this in our projects or ever)

	Rules:
	1) Tables must have a primary key (can be a composite key, a PK made up of multiple columns)
	2) Columns must be atomic (cells should only contain the smallest piece of data possible)

--cool, we are fully in 3NF, which is what we typically want. 

--Note that the homes table does not depend on superheroes. Superheroes depend on homes
--We have a home with two heros related to it, one home (ben's house) has no heroes related to it
--The relation matter to heros, it doesn't matter as much to homes.


--JOINS-------------------------

--insert a superhero with no home
INSERT INTO superheroes (hero_name, hero_power, first_name, last_name, home_id_fk)
VALUES ('Hancock', 'Power Slap', 'Will', 'Smith', NULL);

--Remember, joins are necessary when we want to SELECT data from multiple tables. MULTI-TABLE QUERIES!!

--INNER JOIN
--return all records with matching data/results (typically from the PK/FK) in both tables
SELECT * FROM superheroes INNER JOIN homes ON home_id_fk = home_id;

--LEFT JOIN
--returns all records from the left table, and matching records on the right table
SELECT * FROM superheroes LEFT JOIN homes ON home_id_fk = home_id;

--RIGHT JOIN
--returns all records from the right table, and matching records on the left table
SELECT * FROM superheroes RIGHT JOIN homes ON home_id_fk = home_id;

--RIGHT VS LEFT? This is determined by the position of the table in the join SYNTAX
--LEFT_TABLE JOIN RIGHT_TABLE

--FULL JOIN (AKA FULL OUTER JOIN)
--return everything.
