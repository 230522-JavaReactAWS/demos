<!-- Just like XML this is how we comment things in HTML
        It can also be multiline-->

<!-- The first non-commented line of our HTMl doc needs to be our doctype directive
    This basically tells the browser what version of HTML to render the page in -->
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<!-- This denotes we are using an html doc and it is html 5 -->


<!-- Next we need the actual ROOT tag of our page which will be our HTML tag -->
<html>

<!-- There are two major tags underneath the html tag, the first is head and the second is body

    Head provides important metadata about the webpage that is not directly visible-->

    <head>
        <!-- Tags that may be included inside here refer to information about the page such as:
                        - <style> to apply internal CSS styling to the page
                        - <link> this will be used to link external resources (external CSS)
                        - <script> to make use of JS files or logic
                        - <meta> tags to include metadata for SEO operations
                        - <title> provides a title for the webpage (displays on the top of the browser) -->

        <title> HTML Basic Structure</title>

        <!-- Body tag will contain all of the information directly displayed to the end user, when rendered by the browser -->

                     HTML tags/elements
                         Used to indicate how content should be displayed. Usually
                         will require an opening and a closing tag, those that do
                         not require closing tags are known as "self-closing" tags.

                         <h#>    headings (range from 1-6, 1 being the largest)
                         <div>   division/divider; used to group related elements together
                         <img/>   image (self-closing)
                         <a>     anchor; used to create links to other webpages, or to sections of the current page
                         <br/>    line break (self-closing)
                         <hr/>    horizontal rule (self-closing)
                         <input/> creates a field for user input or some sort of [text, checkbox, etc.] (self-closing)
                     Attributes
                             HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional
                             information about the contents of an element. They appear
                             within the opening tags of an HTML element, and are made of
                             two parts: a name/key, and a value. The name and the value are
                             separated by an equals sign (=). The value of an attribute is 
                             encapsulated within double quotes ("").
